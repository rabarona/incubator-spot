			            <h1>Introduction</h1>
			            <p>
			                Apache Spot (incubating) is a solution built to leverage strong technology in both &#34;big data&#34; and scientific computing disciplines. While the solution solves problems end-to-end, components may be leveraged individually or integrated into other solutions. All components can output data in CSV format, maximizing interoperability.
			                <br>
			            </p>
			            <img src="images/1.1_technical_overviewv02.jpg" style="margin:30px 0;" alt="" /><br><br>            
			            <h3>Parallel Ingest Framework.</h3>
			            <p>
			                The system uses decoders optimized from open source, that decodes binary flow and packet data, then loading the data in HDFS and data structures inside Hadoop. The decoded data is stored in multiple formats so it is available for searching, used by machine learning, transfer to law enforcement, or inputs to other systems.
			            </p>
			            <h3>Machine Learning.</h3>
			            <p>
			                The system uses a combination of Apache Spark to run scalable machine learning algorithms. The machine learning component works not only as a filter for separating bad traffic from benign, but also as a way to characterize the unique behavior of network traffic in an organization.
			            </p>
			            <h3>Operational Analytics.</h3>
			            <p>
			                In addition to machine learning, a proven process of context enrichment, noise filtering, whitelisting, and heuristics are applied to network data to produce a short list of the most likely patterns, which may be security threats.<br><br>

			            <h1>Environment</h1>
			            <h3>Pure Hadoop</h3>
			            <p>
			                Apache Spot (incubating) can be installed on a new or existing Hadoop cluster, its components viewed as services and distributed according to common roles in the cluster. One approach is to follow the community validated deployment of CDH (see diagram below).<br><br>
			
			                This approach is recommended for customers with a dedicated cluster for use of the solution or a security data lake; it takes advantage of existing investment in hardware and software. The disadvantage of this approach is that it does require the installation of software on Hadoop nodes not managed by systems like Cloudera Manager.<br><br>
			            </p>
			            <img src="images/pure_hadoop.png" alt="" /><br><br>
			
			            <p>
			                In the Pure Hadoop deployment scenario, the ingest component runs on an edge node, which is an expected use of this role. It is required to install some non-Hadoop software to make ingest component work. The Operational Analytics runs on a node intended for browser-based management and user applications, so that all user interfaces are located on a node or nodes with the same role. The Machine Learning (ML) component is installed on worker nodes, as the resource management for an ML pipeline is similar for functions inside and outside Hadoop.<br><br>
			
			                Although both of these deployment options are validated and supported, additional scenarios that combine these approaches are certainly <br><br>    
			            </p>
			            <h3>Hybrid Hadoop</h3>
			
			            <p>
			                On existing Hadoop installations, a different approach involves using additional virtual machines and interacting with Hadoop components (Spark, HDFS) through a gateway node. This approach is recommended for customers with a Hadoop environment hosting heterogeneous use cases, where minimal deviation from node roles is desired. The disadvantage is that virtual machines must be sized properly according to workloads.<br><br>
			            </p>
			            <img src="images/hybrid_hadoop.png" alt="" /><br><br>
			
			            <p>
			                In addition to the services deployed on the existing cluster, additional Virtual Machines (VMs) are required to host the non-Hadoop functions of the solution. The gateway service is required for some of these VMs to allow for interaction with Spark, Hive, and HDFS.<br><br>
			            </p>
			
			            <strong>Note:</strong> While the above condition is a recommended layout for production, pilot deployments may be chosen to combine the above roles into fewer VMs. Each component of the Apache Spot (incubating) solution has integral interactions with Hadoop, but its non-Hadoop processing and memory requirements are separable with this approach.<br><br>

			                <p class="orange-bold" style="margin-bottom:0;">There are four components in apache spot (incubating):</p>
			                <ul>
			                    <li><strong>spot-setup</strong> &mdash;  scripts that create the required HDFS paths, hive tables and configuration for apache spot (incubating).</li>
			                    <li><strong>spot-ingest</strong> &mdash;  binary and log files are captured or transferred into the Hadoop cluster, where they are transformed and loaded into solution data stores.</li>
			                    <li><strong>spot-ml</strong> &mdash;  machine learning algorithms are used to add additional learning information to the ingest data, which is used to filter and sort raw data.</li>
			                    <li><strong>spot-oa</strong>&mdash;  data output from the machine learning component is augmented with context and heuristics, then is available to the user for interacting with it.</li>
			                </ul> 
			                While all of the components can be installed on the same server in a development or test scenario, the recommended configuration for production is to map the components to specific server roles in a Hadoop cluster.<br><br>

In order to assign a risk to a specific connection, select it using a combination of all the combo boxes, select the correct risk rating (1=High risk, 2 = Medium/Potential risk, 3 = Low/Accepted risk) and click Score button. Selecting a value from each list will narrow down the coincidences, therefore if the analyst wishes to score all connections with one same relevant attribute (i.e. src port 80), then select only the combo boxes that are relevant and leave the rest at the first row at the top.</p>

			                    <h4 class="gray">The Save button</h4>
			                    <p class="short-mrg">Analysts must use Save button in order to store the scored connections. After you click it, the rest of the frames in the page will be refreshed and the connections that you already scored will disappear on the suspicious connects page, including from the lists in the notebook. This will also reorder the flow_scores.csv file to move all scored connections to the end of the file and sort the rest by severity value. A shell script will be executed to copy the file with the scored connections to the ML Node and specific path. The following values will be obtained from the .conf file:</p>
			
			                        <ul>
			                            <li>LPATH</li>

			                        <p class="short-mrg">For this process to work correctly, it's important to create an ssh key to enable secure communication between nodes, in this case, the ML node and the node where the UI runs. To learn more on how to create and copy the ssh key, please refer to the "Configure User Accounts" section.</p>

                        Apache Spot is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
